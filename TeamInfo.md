## Project Summary

This is a summary of the project:

We will create a website that will increase the rate of graduation for ECE majors. This will help incoming freshmen in ECE plan out their academic schedules for their 4 years at UIUC and choose professors. This is also a good website for sophomores, juniors and seniors to reference back to during course selection.
